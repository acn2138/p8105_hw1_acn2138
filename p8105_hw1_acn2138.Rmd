I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
df_1 = tibble(
              a = rnorm(10),
              b =,
              c = c("a", "Character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "in", "column", "lettered", "c"),
              d = factor(c("low", "medium", "high")))
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

THe code chunk below creates a dataframe and generates a plot.
```{r plot_example}

library(tidyverse)

plot_df= tibble(x = rnorm(500, mean = 2, sd = 4),
                  y = 3 - 4.2 * x + rnorm(500))
                  
ggplot(plot_df,aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()

```
